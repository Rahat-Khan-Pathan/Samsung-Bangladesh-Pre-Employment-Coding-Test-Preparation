It is a well-researched fact that men in a restroom generally prefer to maximize their distance from already occupied stalls, by occupying the middle of the longest sequence of unoccupied places. For example, consider the situation where ten stalls are empty.

The first visitor will occupy a middle position:
_ _ _ _ _ X _ _ _ _
The next visitor will be in the middle of the empty area at the left.
_ _ X _ _ X _ _ _ _


Example of the output for the number of stalls = 10
_ _ _ _ X _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ X _ _ X _ _

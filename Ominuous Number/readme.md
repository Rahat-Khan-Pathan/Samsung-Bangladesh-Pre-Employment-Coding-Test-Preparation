# Ominuous Number Problem

## Problem Description

A company sells products, each identified by a unique serial number. Some serial numbers are considered "ominous" if they contain a specific digit or pattern that affects the product's sales. You need to determine which products are likely to sell based on their serial numbers.

A product is considered to **not sell** if its serial number contains at most `k` occurrences of a specified ominous digit or pattern. You need to count how many products in a given range do not contain the ominous digit or pattern more than `k` times.

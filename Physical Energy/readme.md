Initially you have H amount of energy and D distance to travel. You may travel with any of the given 5 speeds. But you may only travel in units of 1 km. For each km distance traveled, you will spend corresponding amount of energy.e.g. the given speeds are:

Cost of traveling 1 km: [4, 5, 2, 3, 6]
Time taken to travel 1 km: [200, 210, 230, 235, 215]

Find minimum time required to cover total D km with remaining H >= 0

1 <= H <= 4000
1 <= D <= 1000
